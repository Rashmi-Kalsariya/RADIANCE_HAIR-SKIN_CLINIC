# üè¢ Professional SMTP Setup for Radiance Hair & Skin Clinic

## üéØ **Why Company Domain Email?**

Using your company domain email (like `info@radianceclinic.com`) instead of Gmail provides:
- ‚úÖ **Professional branding** - Emails come from your domain
- ‚úÖ **Trust & credibility** - Customers see your brand name
- ‚úÖ **Better deliverability** - Less likely to be marked as spam
- ‚úÖ **Brand consistency** - Matches your website domain

   - **Namecheap** - ‚Çπ150/month

### **Option B: Use Existing Hosting**
If you already have website hosting, most providers include email:
